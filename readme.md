# Introduction

World of Alpheratz is a simple retro platformer demo game made with Godot 4.

Currently it has only one level with basic mechanics, if you guys like it I will continue to develop it in my free time or contact me if you want to help me with the development (it will not be a commercial game).

The project (art is not inclueded, they have seperate licenses, see `assets_source.md`) is under MIT license, so you can use it as a base for your own game and I am glad if you do so.
